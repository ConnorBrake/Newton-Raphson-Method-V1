# Newton-Raphson-Method-V1
This program implements the Newton–Raphson method to numerically approximate the roots of a real-valued function.

Users provide:

*a mathematical function

*its derivative

*an initial guess

*a desired precision

The program iteratively applies the Newton–Raphson update formula until the approximation converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached. The final result is displayed both as a raw approximation and a rounded value.

Features

User-defined functions and derivatives

Adjustable precision

Early stopping when convergence is reached

Simple, readable Python implementation

Notes

Functions are evaluated using Python’s eval() and the math library

Intended for educational use and numerical methods practice
